# Shoppies
This tool will help you choose your nominations for this year's Shoppie awards. Search the OMDB database for your favorite movies and add them to/remove them from from your nominations list as needed. You'll be notified when you've reached the required number of nominations (5). If you leave the page, your results will be saved and you'll be prompted to resume or start over when you return.

## technology / installation
This is a simple full-stack application built using React, Webpack, and CSS on the frontend (with localStorage for persistence), and a small Node/Express server on the backend. We're obtaining search data from the OMDB API.

To run the app on your local machine, clone this repo and run npm install inside the project folder. Run npm start to launch the server at port 8000 (localhost:8000) and bundle the frontend in watch mode. You must have node installed on your machine to run the project.

## deployment
This app is deployed via GitHub pages and available at https://madelineurl.github.io/shopify-challenge/.
